<!-- Download and run the binary from releases to patch your brickadia game/server steam binaries. -->

Setup is manual at the moment...

## Manual Setup

This project depends on compiling UE4SS from source for the dlls. The CI will automatically do this but due to licensing, the complete source cannot be provided here.

### 1. Setup Accounts

Create a Github and Epic account. Link them at [epicgames.com](https://www.epicgames.com/account/connections).

This is required to access [Re-UE4SS/UEPseudo](https://github.com/Re-UE4SS/UEPseudo/), a fork of [EpicGames/UnrealEngine](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine), required to compile the UE4SS binaries.

After you've linked your account, [generate an ssh-key](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen) (I recommend `-t ed25519`) and [add it to your github account](https://github.com/settings/keys). This is required to git-clone-submodules from the private repositories.

### 2. Compile UE4SS

Skip this step by downloading the `dwmapi.dll` and `UE4SS.dll` from the [latest release](https://github.com/brickadia-community/br-lua-patcher/releases) and copying them to the `assets` directory.

1. Download [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and install a version of MSVC that supports C++23 (Desktop C++)
2. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. Download [xmake](https://xmake.io/guide/quick-start.html#windows) and add to a folder in the a directory in your PATH [environment variable](https://www.howtogeek.com/787217/how-to-edit-environment-variables-on-windows-10-or-11/)
4. Download [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
5. `git clone git@github.com:UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS.git` (and `cd` to this dir)
7. `git submodule update --init --recursive`
<!-- This is supposed to work too -->
<!-- `xmake f -m "Game__Shipping__Win64" -y` -->
<!-- `xmake build` -->
8. (Optional?) Copy [`raw_pbd_xmake.lua`](./raw_pdb_xmake.lua) to `RE-UE4SS/deps/third-repo/packages/r/raw_pdb/xmake.lua`
9. `xmake project -k vsxmake2022 -m "Game__Shipping__Win64`
10. Open `vsxmake2022/RE-UE4SS.sln` in Visual Studio
11. In the "Build" menu, select "Build UE4SS" to compile the UE4SS binaries (This may take a while)
12. Copy `RE-UE4SS/Binaries/Game__Shipping__Win64/proxy/dwmapi.dll` to `assets/dwmapi.dll`
13. Copy `RE-UE4SS/Binaries/Game__Shipping__Win64/UE4SS/UE4SS.dll` to `assets/UE4SS.dll`

### 3. Compile and Run

1. `cargo run` (You should already have Rust installed from step 2)
2. Re-read ðŸ‘€ the [NOTICE](#notice)
3. select Y to patch Brickadia and copy the files
